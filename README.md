# ph-prediction-gomec

This project aims to predict pH levels in ocean water using environmental data collected from the **Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Carbon (GOMEC) Cruise** dataset. The project explores various regression models to estimate pH based on water chemistry features like temperature, salinity, and carbon concentrations.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing from GOMEC_UW.csv  
- Feature selection for effective pH prediction  
- Regression modeling using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests  
- Model evaluation with R² score and MAE  
- Visualization of prediction trends and feature impact

## 📁 Project Structure  
- `final project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization  
- `GOMEC_UW.csv` – Raw environmental dataset with features like temperature, pCO₂, salinity, and pH  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## 🧪 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
