# ph-prediction-gomec

This project predicts pH levels in ocean water using environmental data collected from the **Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Carbon (GOMEC) Cruise** dataset. The analysis explores multiple regression models to estimate pH based on water chemistry features such as temperature, salinity, and carbon concentrations.
